# Data Structures and Algorithms Repository

This repository contains solutions to various data structure and algorithm problems implemented in Java and C++.

## Problem Descriptions

### 1. Isomorphic String

**Problem Statement:**

Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character but a character may map to itself.

**Examples:**

1. Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
   Output: true

2. Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
   Output: false

3. Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
   Output: true

### 2. Two Sum Problem

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

You can return the answer in any order.

**Examples:**

1. Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
   Output: [0, 1] (nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 7 = 9)

2. Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
   Output: [1, 2] (nums[1] + nums[2] = 2 + 4 = 6)

3. Input: nums = [3, 3], target = 6
   Output: [0, 1] (nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 3 = 6)
